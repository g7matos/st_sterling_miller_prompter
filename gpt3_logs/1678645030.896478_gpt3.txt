Extract the main lessons that are given in the followin excerpt: easier than trying to read the contract on a computer screen or continually flipping back to the definitions page.  3.  What is all this stuff? All commercial contracts generally have the same basic categories of “stuff.” Typically:  Preamble: Gives the name the contract (e.g., Master Services Agreement), the names of the parties and the date entered into. Recitals: These “background” sections are supposed to provide context for the contract (though rarely do so in any useful manner — but where the hell else will you ever see the word “Whereas” unless you’re a member of Congress or Parliament?).  I typically like to just get rid of recitals but the other side usually wants them because they feel they are “supposed” to be there.  If so, spend some time making sure the recitals set out the background correctly and, if you think they are important to your deal, add a provision stating they are part of the operative terms of the agreement.  Otherwise, courts tend to view recitals as subordinate to the operative provisions of the agreement, or worse, not part of the contract at all. Defined terms: Think of these like formulas you will need for your algebra equation. The written meaning of a defined term (usually capitalized words in a contract) tells you what that term means for purposes of the contract. For example, “cost of production” may have a customary meaning in the industry your company operates but what is written as the definition in the contract controls what that term actually means in your deal. Consequently, the guts of any complex deal usually turn on the defined terms and you need to understand them and make sure they are correct for your purposes. Moreover, defined terms, like those Russian “nesting dolls,” often rest within lots of other defined terms, and have carve-outs for other defined terms. When this happens you move from algebra to calculus! Term and termination: How long does the contract last? Under what circumstances can it be extended or terminated early? Often the stated term will be in one section and the early termination provisions will be in another section.  As to the later, one thing that is typically important to most companies is “how do we get out of this deal if it sucks?”  So, this is a place you’re going to want to wallow in the details.  Also, watch out for ambiguity around dates/times (termination, notice, etc.).  For example, if a contract terminates on the 21st is that Midnight of when the 20th becomes the 21st or Midnight when the 21st becomes the 22nd? I could never keep that straight in my mind.  I liked to make it simple and would state something like “this agreement terminates at 11:59 pm Central Standard Time on October 21st, 2019”).  This way, the time and date of the action are crystal clear. Representations and warranties: These are promises that certain statements of fact in the contract are true. Make sure what you promise as true in a contract is a promise you can keep.  Regarding warranties, parties typically set out expressly what they will warrant about the product or service and then expressly disclaim any other warranties (including implied warranties) to the extent permitted by law. Covenants: These are promises made by each party about what they will do under the contract. For example, a vendor typically agrees to provide services or goods. Their customer generally agrees to pay. You should generally look to the business folks to know they can deliver what is promised – but if you ever have doubts take steps to confirm that the company can indeed deliver. Conditions: These aren’t promises about facts or about what the parties will do. Instead, they are qualifiers. For example, a contract may have conditions that, if not satisfied by a given date, result in termination of the contract. Payment: Typically, there is a section for the payment provisions.  Look closely at what happens if payment is late or is missed.  And if your company is one getting paid, be sure the

RESPONSE:

contract requires payment in a form you can use (e.g., U.S. dollars) and that you can get the money without having to jump through too many hoops. Main Lessons: 1. Understand the definitions of capitalized words in the contract to understand the terms of the agreement. 2. Pay attention to the terms and termination clauses to know how long the contract lasts and how it can be ended early. 3. Make sure that any representations and warranties are promises that can be kept, and make sure that payment is in a form that can be used. 4. Be aware of conditions that may result in termination of the contract if not satisfied by a certain date.
