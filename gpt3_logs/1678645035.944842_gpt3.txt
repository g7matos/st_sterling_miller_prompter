PROMPT:

Extract the main lessons that are given in the followin excerpt: contract addresses what happens if payment is late or missed (especially around termination rights and the ability to recoup the cost to collect what’s owed)! Risk allocation: Typically, one of the most important sections in a contract.  Indemnification, for example, is an allocation between contract parties about which one of them bears the risk of specified third party claims. Other ways risk is allocated between the parties include waivers of certain types of damages (e.g., punitive, lost profits, consequential, etc.), limits on liability (e.g., the value of the contract or some multiple thereof), mandated insurance coverages, and hold harmless clauses (clauses that release and hold harmless one of the parties from liability to the other).  As a lawyer, you need to carefully read – and understand – the risk allocation provisions because if something goes wrong these provisions will limit recovery to some extent. Boilerplate: These are the standard legal provisions, such as governing law, choice of forum, dispute resolution processes, notice, assignment, confidentiality, Force Majeure, etc.  Many lawyers make the mistake of thinking they can gloss over the “boilerplate.”  Wrong.  There are actually a lot of traps for the unwary here.  For more on this, see my prior post on boilerplate language.[2] Exhibits and schedules: Crucial information, such as the description of services, service level agreements or pricing, is often tucked away in exhibits and schedules to the contract. Advertisements   4. The “three passes” approach.  One of the best tricks my friend ever taught me was the “three phases” approach to reading a contract.  The next time you read a commercial contract, try approaching it in three passes, where you dive deeper into the material with each pass:  First Pass: This should be a high-level scan of the document. Don’t read too carefully – just get a good sense for how the contract is structured and where all the “stuff” (outlined above) is located. Second Pass: Now go through the contract more carefully. Start with the defined terms and read them carefully once through. Then make your careful second pass through the contract. When a defined term uses another defined term, stop at that place in the sentence and flip to the other defined term. If necessary, use some scratch paper to diagram relationships among defined terms and take notes. Understanding defined terms is often crucial to understanding the contract.  Keep your “glossary” of defined terms handy. As you read the rest of the contract, if the use of a defined term in a sentence doesn’t seem to make sense, check your glossary. Keep making notes on observations and questions as you read. Third Pass: Skim back through the defined terms now that you have read the contract more carefully and see if your understanding of any of them has changed. Find the term and termination provisions and make sure they make sense and fit your deal. Next, focus on the payment provisions (same drill). Then make a pass through the balance of the provisions in whatever order makes sense to you. Now you are ready to discuss the contract with others. You will come to that discussion with questions as contracts always have ambiguity, early drafts always have mistakes, and all contracts ultimately require interpretation. But you will come to the discussion prepared and with a view.  5.  What’s missing?  This can be tricky, like trying to prove a negative, but it’s important to watch out for what’s missing from the contract as you read through it.  This gets easier with more experience, especially as in-house lawyers become more well-versed in the details of the business. One thing that can help a lot is a checklist, either one you create on your own or one in use generally by the legal department (and if you don’t have one consider creating one).  This list should contain key deal terms your company needs to see (or not see) in every contract.  Another trick is simply to stop and

RESPONSE:

ask yourself periodically as you are reading through the contract “What is missing here?” 1. Risk allocation is an important section in a contract and should be carefully read and understood. 2. Boilerplate language should not be glossed over as it can contain traps for the unwary. 3. Exhibits and schedules often contain crucial information. 4. Use a three-pass approach when reading a contract, starting with a high-level scan, then going through defined terms and finally reading the rest of the contract. 5. Look for what is missing from the contract when reading it and use checklists or ask yourself what is missing to help identify any gaps.
