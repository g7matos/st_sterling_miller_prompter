PROMPT:

Extract the main lessons that are given in the followin excerpt: think about all the things that can go wrong, no matter how improbable, and whether there are provisions that deal with that list of horrors.  Alternatively, there may be a section that purports to deal with an issue but the discussion is incomplete.  You may need to fix it.  Part of your goal when reading a contract is to think through any such provisions and ensure they get edited to get the job done the way you/the company want it done.  6.  Danger Zone!  As you read through the contract, watch out for some big potential viper-pits or what Sterling Archer calls – The Danger Zone:  Most Favored Nations clause: a MFN basically requires a party to offer the same services, products, prices, or whatever on the same terms and conditions they offer it to any other party or category of parties.  Watch out for anyone trying to impose such a requirement on your company or, if your offering one, that the company is truly prepared to give it and understands the repercussions.  At one company I worked for, our delegations of authority required that the CEO of the company had to approve accepting or giving an MFN.  That solved a lot of problems. Exclusivity:  Does the contract require exclusivity on the part of one party/both parties?  Is the company truly prepared to do that?  Is there any whiff of competition law problems with exclusivity (same for MFNs)?  Bells should go off if you see exclusivity requirements in a contract. Liquidated damages:  I always paused whenever I saw a liquidated damages provision in a contract I was reviewing.  These clauses provided for a set amount of damages for breach (or the agreement or some specific term).  I would agree to them only in rare circumstances. Sub-Contractors:  Does the contract permit or prohibit sub-contractors?  Depending on how your company operates, this can be an issue.  If sub-contracting is permitted, be sure you protect the company in the event the sub-contractor fails to perform properly. Service levels:  Finally, does the contract require or lack service levels, i.e., metrics of performance where failure to meet them results in a penalty of some nature?  Again, it depends on whether you are giving or getting them but, regardless of which side you are on, ensure that any contract containing a SLA provides for service levels you can live with along with acceptable remedies in the event the levels are not met. 7.  Don’t shoot blanks.  A lot of contracts you will read start out as form agreements.  This means there are likely blanks to fill in.  As you read, watch for those and make sure you note them and that they are properly completed when the time comes.  There’s little more painful than, for example, having a dispute with the other party and going back through a contract after it’s signed to find key provisions contain blanks.  While usually not fatal, it can be very problematic.  8.  “Other” documents.  Just when you think reading the contract cannot get any more painful, you need to watch out for documents and other agreements incorporated by reference.  A lot of contracts also include hyperlinks to webpages.  So, the bad news is you need to gather up these documents and read through the relevant webpages to ensure you understand how they embellish and impact the contract you are reading.  Skipping this step is simply not an option.  And watch out for language that gives the other side the right to unilaterally change the incorporated documents (e.g., terms and conditions incorporated via a hyperlink).  At a minimum, give yourself a termination right if any such changes would materially impact the company’s benefits or obligations under the core contract.   9.  Are the parties right?  Initially, getting parties right sounds like fun.  But, I am talking about the parties to the contract and not the other kind.  Seriously, it is deadly important to make sure the parties signing the contract are the parties who will provide or accept/pay for the services, goods, or whatever

RESPONSE:

the contract is about. If not, the contract may be unenforceable or, worse, you could be stuck with a contract you cannot get out of. Main Lessons: 1. Think through any potential issues and provisions that may need to be edited to ensure the job is done as desired. 2. Be aware of potential viper-pits such as Most Favored Nations clauses and exclusivity requirements. 3. Be aware of any liquidated damages provisions and watch out for sub-contractors. 4. Ensure that service levels are reasonable and acceptable remedies are provided in the event they are not met. 5. Look out for blanks in form agreements and documents incorporated by reference. 6. Make sure the parties signing the contract are the ones providing or accepting/paying for the services, goods, or whatever the contract is about.
