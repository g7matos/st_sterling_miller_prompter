Extract the main lessons that are given in the followin excerpt: TEN THINGS – HOW TO READ A CONTRACT I recently heard from someone I worked with when I was General Counsel of Travelocity.  She was on the business side and worked on a lot of contracts.  She reached out because she remembered an article I had written and posted on the legal department intranet site about “how to read contracts.”  It was something I wrote for the business so they would be better prepared to work with my team on contracts.  Apparently, she still used it over ten years later!  But, she had lost her only copy and wanted to share it with some of her team at her new company so she could coach them up.  She reached out to ask me if I still had a copy that I could share with her.  I did and sent it over to her.  Now she is teaching a new generation of her sales team how to read contracts.  Reading back through it, however, got me thinking about the fact that not all in-house lawyers have a good understanding of how to read a contract – though we would all hate to admit it.  It is not a skill they teach in law school (or least didn’t when I was there, i.e., I never saw an actual contract until I started working at a law firm).  Instead, law schools focus more on contract theory and stuff like that.  Which is all well and good until you’re faced with your first 50-page agreement and realize all that theory isn’t going to help you much as you start to wade through something that reads like a map written in ancient Greek.   I decided to dust it off and revamp it a bit for the readers of this blog.[1]  This edition of “Ten Things” will teach you a few tricks about how contracts are structured and how to look at them so you can understand what’s going on.  As an in-house lawyer, it is vital that you understand how to read contracts – they are the lifeblood of any company and working on them is, in my opinion, the highest and best use of the legal department.  Even if you don’t work on contracts every day, it’s an important skill to develop and it will help you with your day-to-day work because at some point someone will slide a contract over to you to look over for some purpose – yes, even the litigators kept chained to the wall down in the basement waiting to be unleashed.  Moreover, you might want to share a version of this with your business colleagues as the more they understand about contracts (including being willing to actually read them) the better you can serve them and the faster deals can get turned around. Finally, these tips generally apply wherever you are located on the planet, not just the USA.  So, let’s get started:  1.  Contract structure. Contracts are a different type of animal and are unlike any other type of writing you have ever seen before, e.g., books, memos, articles, essays, newspapers. Those formats are structured with the intent that you read them front to back, sequentially, with introductions, transitions, summaries, etc.  Contracts, on the other hand, are structured to collect certain related provisions together, with all sorts of cross-references and other tricky stuff in there (including the use of defined terms and documents incorporated by reference). This structure is not intuitive, which means that your head will explode like that guy in the movie “Scanners” if you try to read a complex contract carefully, from front to back, and expect to understand it on just the first read-through. That’s wishful thinking (and potentially very messy).  Instead, think of contracts like a nice big, juicy algebra problem. And, like algebra, it takes a little practice to get it down.  2.  Get a hard copy. Seriously. Time to fire up the printer. If you try to read a complex contract online only then see my reference to the “Scanners” guy above.  Most contracts require you to flip around a lot, especially when you’re dealing with lots of defined terms. So, step one is to printout a hard copy of the contract. Then make a separate copy of the defined terms and use it as a glossary. Trust me, this is much
